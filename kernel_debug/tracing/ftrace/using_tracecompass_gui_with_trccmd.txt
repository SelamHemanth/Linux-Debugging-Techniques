It is possible to use the very powerful (and beautiful!) Trace Compass GUI to
visualize the trace data you obtained from trace-cmd.

How?

- Firstly, install the Trace Compass GUI
  ref: https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/

- Setup Trace Compass
  - run it
  - navigate to Tools / Add-ons
  - select the following extensoins to be installed:
     - 'Trace Compass ftrace (incubation)'
	 - 'Generic Callstack (incubation)'
  - install them, restart Trace Compass

The 'Trace Compass ftrace (incubation)' extension allows one to import the
binary output generated by trace-cmd(1), called trace.dat by default, into
Trace Compass.

So, now, run our convenient front-end trccmd (or simply run trace-cmd
'manually'), and then, once your tracing run is done and you have verified
that the trace.dat file is present, go to Trace Compass : File / Openi Trace...
and select the trace.dat file.

In the 'Project Explorer' tab:
 - go to Traces
 - right click on the trace.dat there
 - go to
   - Select Trace Type... / Ftrace Format / Binary Ftrace

Done; now you can leverage Trace Compass!
try clicking on different Views; the 'Flame Graph' is v useful..
Tip: export the kernel symbols into a text file ands make it visible to
Trace Compass. More on this here:
